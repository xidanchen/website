      <description>I was working on a project for which I need to run around 50 sets of comparisons of nested models. For the non-normal continuous data I was working with, I used the MLR as estimation method. Mplus unfortunately wonâ€™t compute the chi-square difference test using MLR chi-square. Following their guide here http://www.statmodel.com/chidiff.shtml, I therefore wrote these functions to automate my analysis. Although these functions were written for my own analysis using MLR, the same functions could also be used for MLM (Satorra-Bentler) and WLSM chi-square.</description>
